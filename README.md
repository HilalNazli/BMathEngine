# BMathEngine
June-July 2014
This is the task I was given during my internship at BITES - Defence &
 Aerospace Technologies. I was asked to create a BMathEngine class, 
which handles arithmetic operations in arrays, using OpenCL. For instance,
 user creates a BMathEngine object and sends two arrays to its add 
function and receives the third as the some of the two. But while 
doing this, the user is not aware of the OpenCL working behind and 
doesnâ€™t have to understand all of the details.
